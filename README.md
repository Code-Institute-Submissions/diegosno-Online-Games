# Design 
## Wireframes

Two main wireframes were used to design the whole layout. I wanted the layout to remain the same throughout the 3 pages (index, game, and feedback), and i wanted the website to look the same on mobile versions but with different proportions. I wanted the popup window not to interfere with the original design so I blended it into the page.

<details> <summary>View wireframe for popup</summary>

## Color scheme
The colors were chosen based on the sky and outer space. I used a dark color for the header to simulate the night sky.
<details> <summary>View header</summary>

Then a light blue color for the body of the page to simulate the sky color.
<details> <summary>View body</summary>

</details>

And finally a rainbow for the footer to simulate that you are over the rainbow!

I did this with the objective to create a cozy layout. 

## Fonts
 I used Google fonts for the website's elements. Two main fonts were used to keep things simple: Press Start 2P for the header to give it a pixelated effect, often related to online games.

And Russo One for the rest of the elements as it is easy to read. 
 <details> <summary>View body font</summary>

# Structure and features
The structure of the website was designed in a way to keep the header on top and the rest of the content below of it, with the footer being at the bottom, which also includes an icon to the developer's Github page.  Navigation is easily identifiable on the top right corner, and the h1 element is clickable on each of the pages to provide with a refresh option to the user.  The website has three pages, a welcome page, the game page, and the feedback page. It is important to note that all main headings texts were created in a way to create emotions in the user, and give a good user experience. 

## Welcome Page
This page contains the game's instructions as well as a start button which is clickable and responsive. 
<details> <summary>View welcome page</summary>

</details>

## Game Page
The page contains the game itself. An h2 is displayed to prompt the user to make a choice, with the options to choose from right beneath. I decided use emojis as the options to catch the user's attention. They are also responsive, and on click they will provide the user with feedback about the game. Right below a message will display "YAY!" when the user wins, "DRAW!" if it is a tie, and NAW! if the CPU wins. The user's and CPU choices will update as well as the scoreboard.
 <details> <summary>View game page</summary>

</details>

 When the game comes to an end a popup is shown up to let the user know if they won or not and a big button to restart the game. I added the popup because I didn't want the user to be taken outside of the page as this can sometimes be tiresome. The popup contains a restart button which on click resets the game values and closes the popup to allow the user to play again. 
 <details> <summary>View popup</summary>

</details>

## Feedback Page 
The feedback page contains a form where the user can provide general feedback, and a submit button which is responsive and provides feedback to the user's request by changing its text from "submit" to "sending.." to "sent".
 <details> <summary>View feedback page</summary>

If used improperly, the form will provide feedback as well.

If the user sends an message, I will receive it as an email. EmailJS was used to add this feature.

To test the performance I used Google Lighthouse. Tests ran smoothly with just a minor detail in the feedback page regarding an issue logged into the panel in Chrome Devtools.

## Testing 

I performed testing using an iPhone 13 Pro and a MacBook Pro, 13-inch, M1, 2020. 

I also performed testing on the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers. 

## Bugs

| Bug | Solution |
| :-------: | :-------: |
| Console was showing that the value for restartButton was null even thought it was assigned | Added an if statement  |
| Text was appearing below the popup on the game page| Changed popup height to 100% |
| H1 was not clickable in the pages | Moved its position below the header element|
| Popup was covering the h1 when showing on game page| Moved it down by changing its top %|
| When the popup showed up there was space left below the footer| Changed popup and overlay position from absolute to fixed|



# Deployment 

The site was deployed using GitHub pages. To publish the website from the GitHub repository, I followed these steps:

Go to the Settings tab in your GitHub repository.
Select Pages from the left-hand menu.
Under Source, select main Branch.
Click Save.
Wait for GitHub to refresh, and the website will be published from the repository.
The website's link will appear: "Your site is published at https://yourusername.github.io/Online-Games/".
